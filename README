Sites Plugin Version 0.1 alt
------------------------------

This plugin enables multi-site support for Croogo (Original statement by the original author "rchavik"). This is an alternative version with a simpler and more comfortable GUI, some bugfixes and the possibility to choose a default site on your own. The default site represents the site that is going to be rendered in case there is no valid domain/subdomain/whatever specified.

On activation the database is automatically created and a default site is set up. Enjoy!
